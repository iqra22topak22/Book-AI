I still remember the first time I wrote a simple “Hello World” program. It felt like I had unlocked a new language — a language that didn’t belong to any country, but to the future itself.\n\nIn 2023, I joined GIAIC, one of the most influential academies in shaping my technical foundation. hich sharpened my practical skills and introduced me to real-world development.\n\nToday, as I continue learning from GIAIC platform, I realize that programming isn’t just a subject — it’s a universe.\n\n🚀 Entering the World of Artificial Intelligence\n\nArtificial Intelligence was not just a topic in my syllabus — it was a turning point.\nThe idea that machines can analyze, learn, make decisions, and even interact like humans fascinated me. I learned:\n\nHow AI agents process information\n\nHow machine learning models identify patterns\n\nHow automation can transform simple tasks into intelligent workflows\n\nThe more I explored AI, the more I fell in love with its endless possibilities. It taught me to think logically, experiment fearlessly, and trust the process — even when the results weren’t perfect.\n\n🤖 Discovering Robotics & Physical AI\n\nWhile AI fascinated my mind, robotics touched my imagination.\n\nI realized that AI becomes truly powerful when it interacts with the physical world — when it takes shape in the form of humanoid robots, robotic arms, self-balancing machines, and intelligent systems.\n\nThis curiosity inspired me to start writing my book, “Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics.”\n\nThe process was not easy:\n\nErrors felt overwhelming\n\nCircuits sometimes burned\n\nPrograms refused to run\n\nSensors acted unpredictably\n\nBut every challenge was a lesson. Every failure taught me something new about persistence, creativity, and problem-solving.\nAnd slowly, I started seeing a version of myself I had never imagined — someone capable of building the future.\n\n💻 The Skills That Shaped Me\n\nOver time, I developed a strong foundation in programming, thanks to mentors, academies, and countless hours of practice.\n\nFrom GIAIC:\n\nTypeScript & Next.js for modern full-stack web development\n\nPython & Agentic AI for creating intelligent systems\n\nJavaScript & React for building interactive interfaces\n\nHTML & CSS for mastering the building blocks of the web\n\nThese skills became my toolkit — tools I now use to bring my ideas to life.\n\n✨ Why I Started This Blog\n\nThis blog is more than a place to write. It is:\n\nA space to share my experiences\n\nA home for my projects and ideas\n\nA journal of my growth\n\nA guide for anyone starting their own journey\n\nI want beginners, especially young girls, to read my posts and think:\n“If she can do it, I can too.”\n\n🎯 My Vision for the Future\n\nI don’t just want to learn AI and robotics — I want to create with them.\n\nI want to:\n\nBuild humanoid robots\n\nDevelop intelligent systems\n\nShare practical AI knowledge\n\nInspire others to step into technology\n\nContribute to the future of automation and robotics in Pakistan and beyond\n\nThis blog will grow with me — evolving from tutorials to projects, from ideas to innovations.\n\n💬 Final Thoughts: A New Beginning\n\nStarting something new always brings a mix of excitement and nervousness.\nBut I believe the first step is the most powerful one, and today, I’m proud of the step I’ve taken.\n\nIf you are reading this, thank you for being here at the very beginning of my journey.\nI hope my words inspire you to explore your own potential — because the future belongs to those who dare to learn.\n\nWelcome to my world of AI, Robotics, and endless discovery.\nThe journey has just begun. 🌸✨"},{"id":"first-blog-post","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/first-blog-post","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2019-05-28-first-blog-post.md","source":"@site/blog/2019-05-28-first-blog-post.md","title":"First Blog Post","description":"🌟 My First Step Into the World of AI & Robotics","date":"2019-05-28T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Hola","permalink":"/blog/tags/hola","description":"Hola tag description"},{"inline":false,"label":"Docusaurus","permalink":"/blog/tags/docusaurus","description":"Docusaurus tag description"}],"readingTime":1.42,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Iqra Mushtaq","title":"Physical AI & Robotics Developer & Student","description":"Started programming with GIAIC (TypeScript, Next.js, Python, Agentic AI) in 2023 and SMIT (JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS) in 2024.
