# Physical AI Book Constitution

## Core Principles

### Accuracy and Verification
All content must be verified against official documentation sources (Docusaurus, GitHub Pages, physical AI frameworks, research papers). Claims about physical AI concepts, implementations, or techniques must be backed by authoritative sources. All content must include inline citations and references to official documentation or peer-reviewed research.

### Clarity and Accessibility
Content must be written for a beginner to intermediate audience. Technical concepts should be explained clearly with sufficient background information. Complex topics should be broken down into digestible sections with examples and illustrations where appropriate. Writing clarity must meet Flesch-Kincaid Grade 8-10 standards.

### Hands-On Learning Approach
Every concept introduced must be accompanied by practical, hands-on examples. Readers should be able to follow along with real implementations, experiments, or projects that reinforce theoretical concepts. Theory without practice is insufficient. Each chapter must include at least one executable example or tutorial.

### Reproducibility
All examples, code snippets, setups, and procedures must work when followed exactly as written. Instructions should be detailed enough that readers can reproduce results from a clean environment without requiring additional undocumented steps. All code examples must be tested and validated in clean environments.

### Documentation Excellence
Using Docusaurus as the documentation platform means maintaining high standards for navigation, searchability, and presentation. Content structure should leverage Docusaurus features for optimal user experience, including proper use of admonitions, tabs, and diagrams.

### Spec-Driven Content Creation
All book content must follow the Spec-Kit Plus structure (Specs → Topics → Tasks → Artifacts). Each chapter or section must have clear specifications before writing begins. Content must be planned with clear user stories and acceptance criteria before implementation.

## Content Standards

### Technical Requirements
- Book must compile correctly using Docusaurus and deploy to GitHub Pages
- All code examples must be properly formatted with syntax highlighting
- Mathematical equations must be rendered using appropriate Docusaurus plugins
- Diagrams and figures must be in scalable formats (SVG preferred)
- All links must be validated and include fallbacks where possible

### Quality Benchmarks
- Professional, polished writing with correct citations
- 20-60 pages in length (~10,000-20,000 words)
- Open-source compatible content (MIT/Apache-2 license)
- All AI-generated content must be validated by human reviewers

## Development Workflow

Content must follow the Spec-Kit Plus methodology with adaptations for documentation:
1. Specs: Define chapters with user stories and success criteria
2. Plan: Detail technical approach and project structure
3. Tasks: Break down into specific writing/implementation tasks
4. Implementation: Write and validate content
5. Review: Verify accuracy, clarity, and reproducibility

Each deliverable must be reviewed against the core principles before acceptance.
