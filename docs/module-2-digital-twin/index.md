# Module 2: Digital Twin

## Overview

This module focuses on creating digital twin environments using Gazebo and Unity. Students will learn to model physical systems in simulation, including accurate physics, sensors, and environmental conditions.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, students will be able to:
- Create accurate simulation environments in Gazebo
- Design Unity environments for digital twin applications
- Model physics properties and constraints
- Integrate sensors in simulation environments
- Validate simulation against physical systems
- Use simulation for testing and development
