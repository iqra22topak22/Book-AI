# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action

## Overview

This module integrates vision, language, and action systems for humanoid robotics. Students will learn to implement systems that respond to voice commands by planning and executing complex tasks involving navigation and manipulation.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, students will be able to:
- Integrate Whisper for voice processing
- Implement LLM-based planning systems
- Create Vision-Language-Action (VLA) pipelines
- Process natural language commands for robotic tasks
- Implement action planning and execution systems
- Integrate all modalities into a cohesive system

## Module Structure

- Week 10: Voice Processing with Whisper
- Week 11: LLM Planning Systems
- Week 12: Vision-Language-Action Integration

## Prerequisites

- Module 1-3 (all previous modules)
- Understanding of machine learning concepts
