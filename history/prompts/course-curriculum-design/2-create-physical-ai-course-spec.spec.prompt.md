# Create Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course Spec

## User Request

Create a feature specification for a Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course:
- Target: Curriculum designers, robotics educators, program directors
- Focus: Teaching embodied intelligence, humanoid robotics, and AI integration
- Technical stack: ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, VLA systems
- Goal: 13-week course with learning outcomes, module structure, hardware plan, capstone project, and Docusaurus documentation
- Constraints: 1,500–2,500 words, focus on teaching + simulation + embodied AI

## Specification Summary

Created comprehensive feature specification for a 13-week Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course targeting curriculum designers, robotics educators, and program directors. The specification includes:

- 3 prioritized user stories covering curriculum design, hardware planning, and documentation structure
- 10 functional requirements defining course structure, technical stack, hardware architecture, and documentation
- 8 measurable success criteria
- 6 key entities for the course components
- Edge case considerations

## Response Summary

Successfully created a complete feature specification for a Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course with all required components. The specification includes user scenarios, functional requirements, success criteria, and key entities, all aligned with the course objectives. The specification is in the `001-course-curriculum-design` branch with the file `specs/001-course-curriculum-design/spec.md`.

## Outcome

The feature specification has been completed within the required 1,500–2,500 word count and covers all specified requirements including the 13-week module breakdown, technical stack (ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, VLA systems), hardware plan (RTX workstations, Jetson kits, Unitree robots), and Docusaurus documentation structure.

## Evaluation
