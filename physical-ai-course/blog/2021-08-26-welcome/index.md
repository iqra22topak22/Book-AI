# 🤖 Physical AI aur Coding Ka Safar

**Assalam u Alaikum! My Name is Iqra Mushtaq.**

🤖 My Journey into Physical AI and Coding

Assalam u Alaikum! My name is Iqra Mushtaq.

This blog is not just about my book “Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics”. It’s also the story of my journey through the world of programming — a place where I learned, built, and grew.

🌟 How My Coding Journey Began

I started my programming journey in 2023 with GIAIC, and in 2024, I joined SMIT. By the end of 2025, I’m still learning from both academies. Every error, every bug, and every project has made me stronger and more confident.

📚 My Programming Skills

These are the essential skills I learned from both platforms:

Learned from GIAIC:

TypeScript & Next.js: Building modern web applications with strong and scalable architecture.

Python & Agentic AI: Creating Artificial Intelligence and advanced automation agents.

Learned from SMIT:

JavaScript & React: Building interactive and user-friendly frontend applications.

HTML & CSS: Understanding the fundamental languages of the web and styling techniques.

💡 My Experience Writing the Book

Writing the book “Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics” was an exciting experience for me. I faced many errors and challenges along the way, but solving each error felt like a new victory. Now, with this book and my new blog, I’m truly excited for what comes next.
