## Overview

This module covers the fundamental concepts of ROS 2, which serves as the "nervous system" for robotic applications. Students will learn about nodes, topics, services, parameters, and the client library interfaces.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, students will be able to:
- Explain the core concepts of ROS 2 architecture
- Create and run ROS 2 nodes in Python and C++
- Implement publisher-subscriber communication patterns
- Use services for request-response communication
- Define and use custom message types
- Work with URDF for robot description
- Interface with ROS 2 using rclpy and rclcpp
