- Identify the key components of ROS 2 architecture
- Explain the difference between ROS 1 and ROS 2
- Set up a basic ROS 2 workspace
- Run a simple ROS 2 network with nodes
- Use ROS 2 command-line tools (ros2 topic, ros2 service, etc.)

## Week 2 Learning Outcomes

By the end of Week 2, students will be able to:

- Create publishers and subscribers for topic-based communication
- Implement services for request-response patterns
- Work with actions for long-running tasks
- Create custom message types
- Design node-to-node communication patterns

## Week 3 Learning Outcomes

By the end of Week 3, students will be able to:

- Define robot models using URDF
- Create robot descriptions with joints and links
